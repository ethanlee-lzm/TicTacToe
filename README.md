# TicTacToe
Learning SFML by creating simple TicTacToe game

Started creating first game with C++ SFML. 
This code is just a continuation of repo created by SonarSystems: https://github.com/SonarSystems/Tic-Tac-Toe-SFML-CPP.
He have also a YouTube tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxKyUwpBmy4&list=PLRtjMdoYXLf4L0UVTggZdTV55baO6x6CO.
This also helped: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/ (all 3 sets).

Some graphics used from https://www.flaticon.com, made by Pixel-perfect.

NOTE: You'll probably need to configure project properties for SFML project and include directories, but i hope you can handle it - its easy.
